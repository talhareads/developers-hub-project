# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects and models, including code for fake news detection, sentiment analysis, and customer segmentation.

---

## Contents

- **FakeVsReal_NEWS_NAIVEBAYESMODELFinal.ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook for detecting fake vs real news using a Naive Bayes classifier. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- **MovieReviewPrediction.ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook for sentiment analysis on movie reviews. Implements text preprocessing, feature extraction, and prediction using machine learning algorithms.

- **customer_segmentation (1).py**  
  Python script for customer segmentation. Uses clustering techniques (such as K-Means) to segment customers based on their features.

- **fake_news_model (3).pkl**  
  Pre-trained fake news detection model saved in pickle format. Can be loaded and used for predicting the authenticity of news articles.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. **Install required dependencies:**
   - Python 3.x
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - scikit-learn
   - pandas
   - numpy

3. **Usage:**
   - Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Notebook to explore and run the code.
   - Use the `.py` script for customer segmentation tasks.
   - Load the `.pkl` model in your Python environment for fake news prediction.

## Example: Loading the Fake News Model

```python
import pickle

with open('fake_news_model (3).pkl', 'rb') as model_file:
    model = pickle.load(model_file)

# Example usage
prediction = model.predict([your_input_features])
```
